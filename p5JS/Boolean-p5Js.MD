## Boolean Variables - p5.js 

Boolean is `true` or `fales`, also a variable can be a Boolean.

```javascripte
let name = true;
```
it is also a boolean, it can happen once the mouse is pressed and it will run untile the mouse is relesed.
```javascripte
mouseIsPressed();
```
but below is not a `boolean`, it is an `event`, the function will start running once the mouse is pressed and until other function no going to occur it will run.
```javascripte
function mouseIsPressed (){

}
```
```javascripte

```
